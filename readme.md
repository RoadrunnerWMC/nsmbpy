# nsmbpy

This is a Python module for working with various file formats from the NSMB franchise. Very work-in-progress, and nobody really uses it but me at the moment...

Please note that installing with setup.py doesn't work at the moment; just copy the module folders into site-packages manually for now. As I said, very work-in-progress :)
