- nsmbpy.level (both course and bgdat)
    - bgdat: data <-> list of Object
    - course:
        - Level class: high-level API like what you'd expect from ndspy
        - loadCourseBlocks() / saveCourseBlocks(): data <-> [block, ]
        - loadSprites() / saveSprites(): data <-> list of Sprite (also used by Level to populate .sprites)
        - etc. Gunpei can use these lower-level functions, while the higher-level ones still exist for those who want them
        - Also, nsmldspy (??) can then make its own equivalent Level class using these building blocks
- Something for chk in nsmbpy.tileset?
- nsmbpy.enpg (([pixel, ], [color16, ]) <-> data)
    Do check to see if these exist elsewhere in NARCs first, though
    Also, rendering to PIL Image, for convenience (like in graphics2D)
